  abstract  = {Much diversity in animal morphology results from variation in the relative size of morphological traits. The scaling relationships, or allometries, that describe relative trait size can vary greatly in both intercept and slope among species or other animal groups. Yet within such groups, individuals typically exhibit low variation in relative trait size. This pattern of high intra- and low intergroup variation may result from natural selection for particular allometries, from developmental constraints restricting differential growth among traits, or both. Here we explore the relative roles of short-term developmental constraints and natural selection in the evolution of the intercept of the allometry between the forewing and hindwing of a butterfly. First, despite a strong genetic correlation between these two traits, we show that artificial selection perpendicular to the forewing?hindwing scaling relationship results in rapid evolution of the allometry intercept. This demonstrates an absence of developmental constraints limiting intercept evolution for this scaling relationship. Mating experiments in a natural environment revealed strong stabilizing selection favoring males with the wild-type allometry intercept over those with derived intercepts. Our results demonstrate that evolution of this component of the forewing?hindwing allometry is not limited by developmental constraints in the short term and that natural selection on allometry intercepts can be powerful.},

abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity, the ability of an organism to change in response to stimuli from the environment, is a result of developmental plasticity, including the environmental sensitivity of behavior during the ontogeny of an individual and of the neural and hormonal mechanisms that underlie behavioral responses. Behavior is expressed as semidiscrete traits or recognizable modular units whose expression is governed by condition-sensitive neural and hormonal mechanisms that can be associated with the expression of particular genes. By tracing these mechanisms the genes subject to selection during the evolution of behavior can be identified. The evolution of behavior can involve reorganization of behavioral units, and selection on them can affect the direction of evolution of associated morphology. Organisms employ mechanisms of environmental assessment that enable behavior to be adaptively plastic, that is, supportive of individual reproductive success. Since virtually all behavior is condition sensitive, ethologists and behavioral ecologists are leaders in analyses of developmental plasticity, and the documentation of adaptive phenotypic modularity, sensory mechanisms of environmental assessment, and switch-controlled conditional alternative phenotypes such as polyphenisms.}

abstract = "Cryptic genetic variation (CGV) is invisible under normal conditions, but it can fuel evolution when circumstances change. In theory, CGV can represent a massive cache of adaptive potential or a pool of deleterious alleles that are in need of constant suppression. CGV emerges from both neutral and selective processes, and it may inform about how human populations respond to change. CGV facilitates adaptation in experimental settings, but does it have an important role in the real world? Here, we review the empirical support for widespread CGV in natural populations, including its potential role in emerging human diseases and the growing evidence of its contribution to evolution.",

abstract = {This paper was written around 2014 for a forthcoming volume of Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science. Since publication of that volume has been long delayed, I am posting this paper on the Philsci Archive. The paper discusses a number of issues having to do with mechanistic explanation in biology. It argues that, as an empirical matter, there is often a kind of correspondence between difference making information and information about spatio-temporal or geometrical relations of a sort emphasized in causal process theories of causation. The paper also discusses modularity conditions and the circumstances under which they fail. Failures of modularity are distinguished from cases involving redundancy and causal cycles.}

  abstract  = {Fifty years ago, Ernst Mayr published a hugely influential paper on the nature of causation in biology, in which he distinguished between proximate and ultimate causes. Mayr equated proximate causation with immediate factors (for example, physiology) and ultimate causation with evolutionary explanations (for example, natural selection). He argued that proximate and ultimate causes addressed different questions and were not alternatives. Mayr{\textquoteright}s account of causation remains widely accepted today, with both positive and negative ramifications. Several current debates in biology (for example, over evolution and development, niche construction, cooperation, and the evolution of language) are linked by a common axis of acceptance/rejection of Mayr{\textquoteright}s model of causation. We argue that Mayr{\textquoteright}s formulation has acted to stabilize the dominant evolutionary paradigm against change but may now hamper progress in the biological sciences.},

  abstract = {For insects that develop inside discrete hosts, both host size and host quality constrain offspring growth, influencing the evolution of body size and life history traits. Using a two-generation common garden experiment, we quantified the contribution of maternal and rearing hosts to differences in growth and life history traits between populations of the seed-feeding beetle Stator limbatus that use a large-seeded host, Acacia greggii, and a small-seeded host, Pseudosamanea guachapele. Populations differed genetically for all traits when beetles were raised in a common garden. Contrary to expectations from the local adaptation hypothesis, beetles from all populations were larger, developed faster and had higher survivorship when reared on seeds of A. greggii (the larger host), irrespective of their native host. We observed two host plant-mediated maternal effects: offspring matured sooner, regardless of their rearing host, when their mothers were reared on P. guachapele (this was not caused by an effect of rearing host on egg size), and females laid larger eggs on P. guachapele. This is the first study to document plasticity by S. limbatus in response to P. guachapele, suggesting that plasticity is an ancestral trait in S. limbatus that likely plays an important role in diet expansion. Although differences between populations in growth and life history traits are likely adaptations to their host plants, host-associated maternal effects, partly mediated by maternal egg size plasticity, influence growth and life history traits and likely play an important role in the evolution of the breadth of S. limbatus’ diet. More generally, phenotypic plasticity mediates the fitness consequences of using novel hosts, likely facilitating colonization of new hosts, but also buffering herbivores from selection post-colonization. Plasticity in response to novel versus normal hosts varied among our study populations such that disentangling the historical role of plasticity in mediating diet evolution requires the consideration of evolutionary history.},

  abstract = {Natural selection is the process that results in adaptive evolution, but it is not the cause of evolution. The cause of natural selection and, therefore, of adaptive evolution, is any environmental factor (agent of selection) that results in differential fitness among phenotypes. Surprisingly little is known about selective agents, how they interact or their relative importance across taxa. Here, I outline three approaches for their investigation: functional analysis, correlational analysis and experimental manipulation. By refocusing attention on the structure and consequences of ecological variation, a better characterisation of selective agents would improve understanding of natural selection and evolution, including adaptive radiation, coevolution, the niche, the evolutionary ecology of the ranges of species and their response to environmental change.},

In this paper, I survey some of the (many!) objections that have been raised to Humeanism, considering how the Humean might respond. And I consider how we might make a positive case for Humeanism. The common thread running through all this is that the viability of the Humean view relies on the Humean having an importantly different conception of explanation to the anti-Humean.},
